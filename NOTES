1. List of regattas: https://api.herenow.com/breeze/BreezeApi/Races

2. Each regatta:
https://api.herenow.com/breeze/BreezeApi/GetScopedRaceFlights?raceId={RACE_ID}&scopeStartTime={DATE}T{TIME}Z&scopeEndTime={DATE}T{TIME}Z

For instance, for the Hooch:
https://api.herenow.com/breeze/BreezeApi/GetScopedRaceFlights?raceId=20559&scopeStartTime=2018-11-03T04:00:00.000Z&scopeEndTime=2018-11-04T23:59:59.999Z

You can make an HTTP request using the curl program and write the result to
a file like: curl -o OUTPUT-FILE URL

Your program should fetch URL #1 and process it, generating a list of #2
URLs with the appropriate race ID and dates substituted (those three bits of
information are found in each object you get back from URL #1).

To format a JSON file named FILE.json for easy reading...
python -m tool.json < FILE.json

Each python script should start with
#!/usr/local/bin/python3

And to make the file executable, do this:
chmod +x FILE.py

To connect to your database (on servant):
    psql theoaracle
